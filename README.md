# Cubtale Case Study

This flutter project is an admin panel for Cubtale that is part of the case study I got as part of the interview process at Cubtale.

The code is divided into 4 layers: Domain, Application, Infrastructure and Presentation. Separation of the code into these layers allows for modularity and scalability while also splitting the UI from the business logic.
